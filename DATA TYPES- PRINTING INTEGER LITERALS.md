# Experiment No: 2- Data Types â€“ Printing Character Literals

## AIM 
To write a Python program to print character literals such as 'T' and 'a'.

## ALGORITHM 

1)Begin the program.
2)Assign character literals (like 'T', 'a') to variables or directly print them using the print() function.
3)Use the print() function to display the characters.
4)Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
## Reg.No-212223050032
## Name-Nidhish B

v ='T'
 
w ='a'
 
print(v)
print(w)

```
