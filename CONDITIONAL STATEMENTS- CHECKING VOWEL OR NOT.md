## Experiment No: 4 â€“ Conditional Statements- Divisible by 9 or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given the number is divisible by 9 or not if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a character input from the user
3. Convert the character to lowercase
4. Check if the lowercase character is one of the vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
5. If it is a vowel, display "The given character is a vowel"
6. Otherwise, display "The given character is NOT a vowel"
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-
# Name-
# Write your code here

# Read the number from the user
number = int(input())

# Check if the number is divisible by 9 using modulo operator
if number % 9 == 0:
    print(number, "is divisible by 9")
else:
    print(number, "is NOT divisible by 9")

```

## OUTPUT

## RESULT

Thus the python program to check whether the given the number is divisible by 9 or not if..else statement was implemented sucessfully
