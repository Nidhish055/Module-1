## Experiment No: 4 â€“ Conditional Statements- Divisible by 9 or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given the number is divisible by 9 or not if..else statement

## ALGORITHM  

1. Start the program.
2. Accept a number from the user
3. Use the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by 9.
4. If number % 9 == 0, then print that the number is divisible by 9.
5. Else, print that the number is not divisible by 9.
6. End the program.

## PROGRAM

```python

# Reg.No-212223050032
# Name-Nidhish B

number = int(input())

if number % 9 == 0:
    print(number, "is divisible by 9")
else:
    print(number, "is NOT divisible by 9")

```
